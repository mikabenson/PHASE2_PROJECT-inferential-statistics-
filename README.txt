Introduction

Our company is entering the film industry by launching a new movie studio but lacks experience in film production. We are tasked with analyzing current box office trends to identify successful film types. The goal is to translate these insights into actionable recommendations that will guide the studio head in creating films that align with market preferences and drive success.

You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
